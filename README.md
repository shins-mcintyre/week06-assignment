# Image Gallery in React

## Requirements

🎯 Implement the useState hook to manage gallery state (e.g. selected image).

<!-- 🎯 Use useEffect for initial fetching of images from an external API. -->

🎯 Return JSX from multiple components (e.g., an ImageItem component for each image and a Gallery component to display them).
🎯 Use the .map() function to render an array of images dynamically
🎯 Implement functionality to display a larger version of an image when its thumbnail is clicked.

<!-- 🎯 Ensure all images have meaningful alt text. -->

🎯 Ensure basic keyboard navigation for image selection (e.g., thumbnails should be focusable and activatable with Enter/Space).

## Stretch Requirements

🏹 Use useEffect and the dependancy array to update the images when the user types in an input field.
🏹 Set up an Unsplash application that you can fetch from your React app.
🏹 Use .env to hide your API keys and tokens from the code.
🏹 Style the application excellently, using grid or flex and positioning.
